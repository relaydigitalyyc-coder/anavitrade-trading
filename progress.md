# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-07-12 (Production Hardening & Deployment)

### SESSION RECOVERY — Last Phase: Production Pipeline Fix
- **Status:** PENDING — D1 Date serialization partially fixed, signal dispatch still disabled
- **Last action:** D1 raw binding bypass for inserts works. Chunked inArray for 100-var limit. Cron counter persists to D1. Code pushed to GitHub (`cd819f8`).
- **Remaining:** analysis_signals bridge still disabled, SMC dispatch commented out, scraper inserts 0 due to remaining Date object somewhere

### Done This Session
- [x] Added 6 CEX exchange clients (Bybit, OKX, Kraken, KuCoin, Gate.io, Coinbase)
- [x] Unified funds flow (syncUnifiedBalance across DEX + CEX)
- [x] Dashboard refactor (1285 → 220 lines, 9 components, 3 hooks)
- [x] Production gap audit (18 routes, fee engine, dispatch, env, error boundaries)
- [x] Worker cron throttle with D1-persisted counter
- [x] Race condition fixes (`.returning()` vs `SELECT DESC LIMIT 1`)
- [x] Deployed to Cloudflare: https://anavitrade-trading.erhazeariel.workers.dev
- [x] ADMIN_API_KEY set, 8 D1 migrations applied
- [x] D1 Date serialization fixed (schema `number` mode + raw D1 binding)
- [x] D1 100-variable limit fixed (chunked inArray)
- [x] Cron counter persisted to global_settings table

### Next Session — Pipeline Priming
1. Fix remaining Date object in scraper (find via `grep -n "new Date(" src/server/coinlegs-scraper.ts`)
2. Re-enable analysis_signals bridge (change schema to `number` mode)
3. Re-enable SMC dispatch in scraper
4. Trigger `POST /api/scraper/run` to confirm signals insert
5. Trigger `POST /api/analysis/run` to confirm analysis engine works
6. Trigger `POST /api/signals/generate` to confirm native generator works
7. Wait for cron to run analysis (5 fires) + outcome (15 fires) + fee (1440 fires)
8. Upgrade wrangler: `npm install --save-dev wrangler@4`

## Session: 2026-07-13 (UI Upgrade Production Caveats Audit)

### Done This Session
- [x] Audited UI upgrade production caveats against `src/config.ts`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/server/worker.ts`, `src/components/dashboard/MarketTickerRail.tsx`, and `src/components/TradingViewMiniWidgets.tsx`.
- [x] Added canonical agent-readable audit note: `docs/ops/2026-07-13-ui-prod-caveats-audit.md`.
- [x] Added root handoff pointer in `CLAUDE.md` and persistent summary in `findings.md`.

### Follow-Up
1. Move production API routing to an explicit `VITE_API_BASE_URL` or equivalent environment contract.
2. Centralize Worker CORS allowed origins and add a trusted preview/custom-domain strategy.
3. Add authenticated dashboard QA with production-like session/data fixtures.
4. Wire `MarketTickerRail` to live market/signal data or scope fallback content as non-authoritative highlights.
5. Add TradingView fallback/timeout UI and continue bundle chunk audits for wallet/chart/provider dependencies.

## Session: 2026-07-13 (Aster Execution Failed State)

### Done This Session
- [x] Traced Aster activation and dispatch failure paths through `src/server/aster/*`, `src/server/execution/*`, D1 schema, and dashboard status UI.
- [x] Changed Aster/execution/NAV timestamp handling to epoch milliseconds to avoid D1 `Date` object serialization failures.
- [x] Added `ASTER_LIVE_ORDER_SUBMISSION_ENABLED` gate; Aster jobs stage instead of failing while live order submission is not explicitly enabled.
- [x] Updated Aster dashboard copy to show staging mode and documented the env flag.
- [x] Verified `npx tsc --noEmit && npx tsc --noEmit -p src/server/tsconfig.json`.
- [x] Verified `npx vite build` passes with existing non-blocking Rollup `ox` warnings.

### Production Follow-Up Checks
1. Keep `ASTER_LIVE_ORDER_SUBMISSION_ENABLED=false` until request signing, order payload, and fill sync are verified end-to-end.
2. Test Aster request signing against testnet or a non-production wallet before any production wallet path.
3. Confirm submitted/filled/rejected order lifecycle rows populate `execution_jobs`, `order_events`, and audit logs correctly.
4. Confirm NAV snapshots reconcile with live Aster fills before fee crystallization consumes them.
5. Re-run `pnpm check && npx vite build` before any push or deployment touching this path.

## Session: 2026-07-14 (Aster/CEX Timestamp Follow-Up)

### Done This Session
- [x] Re-checked the merged Aster staging gate on `main` after remote docs churn.
- [x] Found and fixed remaining CEX dispatch writes that still passed `Date` objects into numeric `execution_jobs` timestamp columns.
- [x] Confirmed the remaining execution-folder `new Date()` write targets `global_settings`, which still uses Drizzle `timestamp_ms`.

## Session: 2026-07-14 (Aster Integration Audit)

### Done This Session
- [x] Compared local Aster implementation against official Aster Futures API V3 docs.
- [x] Replaced incompatible `/fapi/v1/order` JSON/order-struct signing with `/fapi/v3/order` form-urlencoded `AsterSignTransaction` signing.
- [x] Added signed `/fapi/v3/leverage` call before order submission so requested leverage is applied through the supported endpoint.
- [x] Replaced unsafe local-only activation with Aster `registerAndApproveAgent` wallet-signature flow.
- [x] Verified public V3 connectivity to `https://fapi.asterdex.com/fapi/v3/ping` and `/time`.
- [x] Ran a safe signed-order smoke with a throwaway signer; Aster returned `No agent found`, confirming the request reached Aster's signed auth path without risking a real trade.

### Still Requires Non-Production Live Proof
1. Connect a testnet or non-production funded Aster wallet.
2. Complete `registerAndApproveAgent` through the app wallet-signature flow.
3. Temporarily set `ASTER_LIVE_ORDER_SUBMISSION_ENABLED=true` outside production.
4. Submit a tiny limit order, verify `execution_jobs`, `order_events`, order query/fill sync, NAV snapshot, and cancellation/cleanup.
