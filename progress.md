# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-07-18 (Thread Consolidation → Completion PRD)

### Done This Session
- [x] Picked up all open threads: honest-ML-gate PRD (draft), production-safety operator gates,
      Aster new-user onboarding proof, signal-pipeline starvation, uncommitted working tree
- [x] Verified auth dev-registration tests pass (2/2, tests/auth-development-registration.test.ts)
- [x] Verified locked-backtest tooling exists but has never produced a report
- [x] Read meta-v24/v25 training_results.json — AUC 0.52-0.53, numbers not citable (leaky threshold)
- [x] Wrote docs/prd/2026-07-18-completion.md — consolidates 4 PRDs + working tree into
      5 threads (A hygiene, B locked gate, C operator gates, D Aster E2E, E signal pipeline)
      with ordering, dependencies, and permanent release gates

### Next
1. Thread A: land 3 separate commits (auth dev-registration, train.py --input, honest experiment artifacts)
2. Thread B: run scripts/ml/locked-walkforward-backtest.py on 120-day/49-pair corpus
3. Threads C/D/E in parallel per PRD ordering

## Session: 2026-07-16 (Session Unification & Pipeline Priming)

### Context Recovered
Cross-referenced 6 Claude Code session logs from the past 4 days:
- `6f8cbb29`: ML pipeline thread — metacognitive model, multi-TF SMC, "the model IS the edge", no arbitrary scoring, 3+ PF target, "MULTI TIME FRAME ML is the edge"
- `4de29678`: Live/Demo dashboard toggle, demo from 0 trades at registration, Aster live test
- `c417b83f`: Legal alignment, UI polish, IP whitelist UI, ui-designer agent
- `d1f2e389`: UCC1 scraper (separate repo — not relevant here)
- `83804466`: /learn-eval, skill extraction, "remove Coinlegs from frontend"
- `5f23db4e`: TradingView MCP installation

### Done This Session
- [x] Cross-referenced all session logs — merged 6 threads into one unified task plan
- [x] TypeScript checks pass (frontend + server)
- [x] Vite build passes
- [x] Worker deployed with new ADMIN_API_KEY
- [x] Admin endpoints verified working (scraper, analysis engine)
- [x] D1 diagnostics: 2,347 signals, 0 analysis_signals, 0 execution_jobs
- [x] Root cause identified: 1 kline row → analysis engine can't compute indicators
- [x] TradingView Desktop confirmed running with CDP on :9222
- [x] TradingView MCP confirmed installed and configured
- [x] Created scripts/seed-klines.mjs for local kline seeding
- [x] Updated Dockerfile for VPS rebuild
- [x] VPS source tree rsynced with correct directory structure
- [x] Rewrote stale planning files (task_plan.md, progress.md, findings.md)

### SESSION RECOVERY — Last Phase: Full pipeline priming
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS — kline seed + VPS rebuild running in background
- **Background task 1**: seed-klines.mjs (10 pairs × 100 bars × 4h)
- **Background task 2**: VPS Docker rebuild
- **Remaining after klines**: trigger analysis engine, verify signal→intent→execution flow
- **ML**: retrain metacognitive model on full 40K MTF rows, run TradingView backtest

## Session: 2026-07-15
### Done This Session (TradingView MCP)
- [x] Cloned TradingView MCP from github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp
- [x] Installed and configured in ~/.claude/.mcp.json
- [x] TradingView Desktop launched with debug port :9222

## Session: 2026-07-14 (Aster Integration)
### Done This Session
- [x] Replaced /fapi/v1/order with /fapi/v3/order + AsterSignTransaction signing
- [x] Added signed /fapi/v3/leverage call before order submission
- [x] Replaced unsafe local-only activation with registerAndApproveAgent flow
- [x] Verified V3 connectivity to fapi.asterdex.com
- [x] Ran signed-order smoke test (Aster returned "No agent found" = reached signed auth path)

## Session: 2026-07-13 (Aster Execution Failed State)
### Done This Session
- [x] Traced Aster activation and dispatch failure paths
- [x] Changed timestamp handling to epoch milliseconds
- [x] Added ASTER_LIVE_ORDER_SUBMISSION_ENABLED gate
- [x] Updated dashboard to show staging mode

## Session: 2026-07-12 (Production Hardening)
### Done This Session

- [x] D1 100-variable limit fixed (chunked inArray)
- [x] Cron counter persisted to global_settings
- [x] analysis_signals bridge re-enabled
- [x] SMC dispatch active
- [x] Deployed to Cloudflare
- [x] 8 CEX clients added
- [x] Dashboard refactor (1285→220 lines)
