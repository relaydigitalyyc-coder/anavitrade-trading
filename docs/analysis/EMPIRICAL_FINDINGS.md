# ICR Engine — Empirical Findings & Calibrated Config

## Release status — not validated for capital deployment (2026-07-19)

This document records research configuration and historical observations. It is
**not** evidence that an ICR strategy is profitable or suitable for automated
DEX execution.

- The historical parameter sweeps below must not be used as a release gate:
  selecting or narrating favourable settings from the same corpus is not
  out-of-sample validation.
- The production engine and paper lane now evaluate only the just-closed candle
  (`findLatestSignals`). Replaying a full historical window on each cron is
  invalid and must never be used to calculate signal counts or performance.
- As of this update, the retained 4h corpus covers roughly 24 symbols from
  2026-05-27 through 2026-07-18. The corrected fixed-configuration evaluation
  produced only four qualified observations and -4R; that sample is far too
  small to establish an edge, and it does not pass a release gate.
- The paper book has no recorded entries or evaluated outcomes yet. Automated
  dispatch must remain disabled until a predeclared rule path completes the
  required paper/testnet window with documented fees, slippage, and drawdown.

Do not claim user profitability, enable automated signal dispatch, or turn on
live order submission based on the older aggregate figures in this file.

## CRITICAL: Do Not Change These Without Re-Backtesting

These parameters were found through 30-symbol, 6-month sweeps with 655+ signal outcomes. They are NOT arbitrary.

## Current DEFAULT_ICR_CONFIG

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_ICR_CONFIG: IcrConfig = {
  fastMa: 7, midMa: 25, slowMa: 99,
  atrLength: 14, volumeMaLength: 20,
  maSlopeLookback: 5, lookbackStructure: 50,

  // Altcoin-relaxed impulse gates
  minImpulseBars: 2,        // 3 on majors → too few signals on alts
  maxImpulseBars: 14,       // 12 → missed longer altcoin impulses
  minPullbackBars: 2,       // 3 lost too many valid setups
  compressionLookback: 8,   // 10 → too slow for altcoin compression
  maxSignalAgeAfterImpulse: 35, // 28 → lost old but valid setups

  // Altcoin-relaxed multipliers
  impulseAtrMult: 1.2,         // 1.5 gates out most alts (need lower bar)
  impulseVolumeMult: 1.0,
  pullbackVolumeMaxRatio: 1.15,
  compressionRangeRatio: 0.95,
  compressionAtrRatio: 0.99,
  nearMaAtrMult: 1.5,
  maSeparationAtrMult: 0.03,  // 0.05 → too tight for alts
  candleClosePositionThreshold: 0.55, // 0.60 → too strict for alts

  // Empirical thresholds (from 655-outcome sweeps)
  scoreThreshold: 65,  // 75 → too high, lost valid signals
  minRr: 1.5,          // 2.5 → too high, RR naturally high on altcoin impulse setups

  stopAtrBuffer: 0.1,

  // Coil gate: OFF for alts (proven net-negative)
  enableCoilGate: false,  // was true — blocks all altcoin signals
  minCoilScore: 60,       // was 72 — coils on alts naturally score ~46 median

  bonferroniAdjust: true,
  bollingerLength: 20, bollingerStd: 2,

  // Tier thresholds (calibrated from backtest)
  tierAThreshold: 80,  // AVERAGE R > 1.5, WR ~35%
  tierBThreshold: 65,  // AVERAGE R ~0.5, WR ~20%
  // C < 65:              AVERAGE R < 0 (LOSING — skip/paper only)

  // Entry quality filter (proven +17.9R gain over pure runner)
  entryRsiMax: 70,   // reject long if RSI14 >= 70 (chasing extension)
  entryRsiMin: 30,   // reject short if RSI14 <= 30 (chasing extension)
};
```

## What the Backtest Proves

### Tier Quality is Real
- **Tier A (≥80)**: 615 outcomes, +128.85R, avgR +0.21 (PROFITABLE — trade these)
- **Tier B (65-79)**: 40 outcomes, -8.52R, avgR -0.21 (LOSING — paper/skip only)
- The boundary cleanly separates winners from losers. Not random.

### Edge is on Alts, Not Majors
- **ADA**: +60.22R (PF 4.54, Sharpe 1.99)
- **AAVE**: +37.05R (PF 3.47, Sharpe 1.61)
- **SOL**: +32.32R (PF 3.02, Sharpe 1.32)
- **BTC**: -3.12R (negative — market too efficient)
- **BNB**: -26.00R (negative — low ATR, no ICR patterns)
- **ETH**: -4.03R (negative)
- **Rule**: ICR is a volatility-arbitrage strategy. Needs 2-4%+ 4h ATR to trigger impulse gates frequently enough. Majors are 1-2% — too tight.

### Direction Split (Bear Market Context)
- Short signals: 486 outcomes, +204.98R
- Long signals: 169 outcomes, -84.65R
- The engine caught the June 2026 selloff perfectly on shorts. Longs need a bull market to validate.
- **Next enhancement**: Regime/trend filter for direction bias (not implemented, not a blocker).

### Exit Engine: The Tail is Sacred

**CRITICAL FINDING**: On a low-win-rate fat-tailed system like ICR on alts (~19% win rate, avg win ~+8R, max +24R):

| Exit Strategy | TotalR | Sharpe | MaxWin |
|--------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Naive (fixed stop + window close) | +265.9R | 3.32 | 24.4R |
| Fib scale-outs + tight trail + HA flip | -117R | NEGATIVE | CAPPED |
| Wide trail (5ATR, arm@+4R, NO early BE) | +274.8R | 3.47 | 23.4R |

**EVERYTHING that touches the exit caps the tail. The pure runner with wide trail wins.**

- **DO NOT** add early breakeven stops (breakevenAtR=2.0 gave -48% vs naive)
- **DO NOT** add partial scale-outs (20% partial dropped MaxWin 24.4R → 19.4R)
- **DO NOT** add HTF regime exits (HA flip dropped totalR)
- **DO** add exhaustion detection (used at threshold 0.7, only at extremes)
- **DO** keep the wide ratchet trail (5ATR, activate at +4R, never tighten)

### RSI Entry Filter (Proven Gain)

`entryRsiMax:70` / `entryRsiMin:30` raised TotalR 274.8 → 292.7 (+6.5%), Sharpe 3.47 → 3.79:
- Before: 326 trades, WR 20.9%, avgR 0.84, TotalR 274.8, Sharpe 3.47
- After:  273 trades, WR 22.7%, avgR 1.07, TotalR 292.7, Sharpe 3.79
- **Mechanism**: Filters out trades chasing already-extended moves. More trades reach the tail, fewer hit the stop.
- Tighter thresholds (65/35, 60/40) raise WR further but shed too many trades → total R falls.

### Money Flow Direction Filter (Historical-Sweep Candidate, Opt-In — Not a Release Gate)

**Historical replay test** (`scripts/icr-wavetrend-experiment.ts`, 49-pair /
120-day corpus, 4h+1h, chronological 60/40 split, `simulateSmartExit`
untouched) — same historical-sweep methodology as the RSI filter above, and
subject to the same disclaimer at the top of this file: this is NOT
out-of-sample validation and NOT a release gate on its own. A Market Cipher B
Money-Flow oscillator was ported from `scripts/ml/pipeline/features.py` to
`src/server/analysis/indicators.ts::moneyFlow`. Probed against 113 baseline
ICR signals first: 98.6% of shorts already had `moneyFlow < 0`, 76.7% of longs
already had `moneyFlow >= 0` — direction and money flow already agree most of
the time. A single-bar confirmation gate (`enableMoneyFlowFilter`, opt-in,
`IcrConfig`) rejects the minority where they disagree:

| Split | Metric | Baseline | +MoneyFlow filter |
|---|---|---|---|
| Validation | Trades | 369 | 296 (-19.8%) |
| Validation | Win Rate | 48.2% | 49.0% |
| Validation | Profit Factor | 1.71 | 1.75 |
| Validation | Sharpe | 3.68 | 3.82 |
| Validation | Max Drawdown | 44.8% | 24.5% |
| Walk-forward | | PASS | PASS |

Directionally interesting (drawdown nearly halved on this corpus while
PF/Sharpe held flat-to-better, walk-forward passes both sides) but this is one
run on one historical corpus — the exact failure mode this file's release-status
banner warns about. **Not enabled in `DEFAULT_ICR_CONFIG`.** Before any
consideration of enabling it: run against the live paper lane's
`findLatestSignals` path (per-candle, not historical replay) for the same
predeclared window the release-status section requires, with fees/slippage/
drawdown documented, same as any other release-gate candidate.

### WaveTrend Extreme Filter (Two Variants, Both Rejected)

Same experiment also ported `waveTrend` (Market Cipher B) and tried it as an
entry-timing filter two ways — both **eliminated 100% of validation trades**
(walk-forward FAIL) on the same historical corpus, verified as a real
structural mismatch, not a bug:

- **Strict** (`enableWaveTrendExtremeFilter`): wt1 at or beyond ±60 within the
  last 5 candles, then turning back toward zero. 0/49 pairs produced a signal.
- **Simple** (`enableWaveTrendSimpleFilter`): current-candle wt1 beyond ±40,
  no lookback. Also 0/49 pairs.

Root cause, confirmed by direct inspection of wt1 at the candles where ICR
*does* already accept a signal: 0/15 sampled long signals had wt1 <= -40, and
0/34 sampled short signals had wt1 >= +40 — WaveTrend is essentially never at
an extreme when ICR's other 7 gates (impulse → pullback → compression →
trigger) all align. **DO NOT** gate ICR entries on a reversal-timing
oscillator: ICR is a continuation-pattern engine (enters after an impulse has
already started resolving through a pullback), and WaveTrend-extreme measures
the opposite thing — the initial reversal point, before ICR's structural
gates would ever fire. The two entry philosophies are close to mutually
exclusive on this engine. Both fields exist in `IcrConfig`, both are opt-in,
neither is in `DEFAULT_ICR_CONFIG`, and neither should be enabled without a
fundamentally different (reversal-based, not continuation-based) signal
source built alongside them.

### Stochastic RSI (Ported, Not Yet Tested As a Filter)

`stochRsi` was also ported (`src/server/analysis/indicators.ts`) and wired
into `EnrichedCandle.stochRsiK`/`stochRsiD`, but no filter variant has been
built or tested yet. Initial probe (113 baseline signals): longs cluster
p10=32/p50=61/p90=93, shorts p10=9/p50=26/p90=62 — much broader spread than
Money Flow's clean sign-alignment, no obvious single-bar threshold. Left as
an open item, not a finding either way.

## What To Do Next (Future Builder Agents)

### Short-term (before live dispatch):
1. **Deploy to staging**: `wrangler deploy`, test with `POST /api/analysis/run`
2. **Run 2-week paper trade**: `POST /api/paper-trade/run` every 5 min via cron
3. **Fix LogoBar.tsx**: Pre-existing TS error in `src/components/home/sections/LogoBar.tsx(14,46)`
4. **Set production secrets**: `wrangler secret put ADMIN_API_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`

### Medium-term:
5. **BitUniX adapter**: Schema already has `cex_connections` with `exchange="bitunix"`. Just needs the exchange client implementation in `src/server/cex/` following the Binance pattern.
6. **Static egress IP**: Documented in CLAUDE.md — needed for exchange API-key IP whitelisting. Route order signing through a dedicated service with static IP.
7. **Regime filter**: Add a bull/bear regime indicator (e.g., MA200 slope, ATR trend) to bias direction. Engine currently trades long and short equally — a regime filter would avoid fighting the trend.

### Long-term:
8. **Live outcome feedback**: Feed actual trade outcomes back into ICR scoring weights. If MACD on 4h consistently fails to profit on SEI, downweight it. Self-improving model.
9. **Multi-exchange**: BitUniX, Bybit, OKX adapter implementations.
10. **Derivatives alpha live-only**: Binance historical OI/funding data only goes back 30 days. Live-only entry conviction signal. Cannot be backtested on 6-month window. Documented for future calibration.
